# random-messages

Well... this project's name is too self explanatory yet, but I will explain it anyway. This package calls a function named ```random``` that prints random strings from an array called ```messages```, on the terminal, which can be edited with whatever you want.

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-msg
```

# Usage

```bash
random-msg
```
